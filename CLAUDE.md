## Development Setup

No setup steps are required yet. When the project gains a `package.json` or equivalent, update this section with:

- Runtime and version requirements (e.g., Node.js >= 20)
- Install command (e.g., `npm install`)
- Dev server command
- Build command

## Common Commands

_None defined yet._ Update this section as scripts are added to the project.

<!-- Example format for future use:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm test` | Run tests |
| `npm run lint` | Lint source files |

## Architecture

Not yet established. When implemented, document:

- Tech stack choices (language, framework, HTTP library)
- Entry point(s)
- Directory layout conventions (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`)
- Key abstractions and data flow

## Code Conventions

- Language and style (TypeScript strict mode, ESLint config, Prettier, etc.)
- Naming conventions (files, variables, types)
- Import ordering
- Error handling patterns
- Commit message format

## Testing

No test infrastructure yet. When tests are added, document:

- Test framework (e.g., Vitest, Jest)
- How to run tests (`npm test`)
- Test file naming and location conventions
- Coverage requirements

## CI/CD

No CI/CD pipelines configured. When added, document:

- Pipeline tool (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Required checks before merge
- Deployment process
