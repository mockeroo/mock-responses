  "Whatever you're looking for, it's not here. Just like my will to help you.",
  "404: Your request, much like your social life, could not be found.",
  "It's gone. Poof. Maybe it never existed. Like your debugging skills.",
  "Not found. Have you tried looking under the couch cushions?",
  "The resource you requested has left the chat.",
  "Looked everywhere. Under the server rack, behind the firewall. Nope.",
  "This page is playing hide and seek. It's winning.",
  "404: Page not found. But you know what else isn't found? My patience.",
  "Gone. Vanished. Disappeared. Much like my motivation.",
  "If this resource was a person, it'd be in witness protection."
